# Autodocodec

Autodocodec is short for "self(auto)- documenting encoder and decoder".

## Goals:

* Correct-by-construction encoding and decoding, without generating code.
* Generate automatically-correct documentation from code.
* Fun but not important: Be able to provide instances without depending on aeson and/or yaml.
* Would be nice: support for recursive types.
